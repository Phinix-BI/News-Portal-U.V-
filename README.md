Built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, this project delivers an immersive news experience, offering both users and administrators robust functionalities.

<b>Work in Progress....</b>

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Open the Command Line by pressing Win + r and then typing 'cmd'.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: 'git clone https://github.com/Phinix-BI/News-Portal-U.V-.git'
3. Change the directory to the project folder: 'cd News-Portal-U.V-'
4. Run `npm init -y` in the main directory.
5. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
6. Navigate to the `client` directory and install frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
7. Create an `.env` file in the backend and configure the following:

   ```env
   clientUrl=Replace with you frontend url //Example http://localhost:3001
   BASEURL=Replace with you frontend url //Example http://localhost:3000
   saltRounds=10
   masterid=yourID@admin.self.com
   masterPass=strongKey
   sessionKey=strongKey

8. Similarly, in the backend directory, install backend dependencies with `npm install`.

9. Go to the main directory and run `npm start`. By default, the client's package.json sets the port to 3001 for running, but you can change it according to your preferences.
